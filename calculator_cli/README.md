# Project description and instructions

1.
Define the Features of Your Calculator

Before diving into coding, define the functionality:

Basic Operations:
Addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/).


Input and Output:
Accept user input in the form: 5 + 3.
Display the result: 8.


Error Handling:
Invalid input: "5 & 3" → Show an error message.
Division by zero: "10 / 0" → Show an error message.

2.
Build Incrementally

Start Simple:
Focus on a single operation (e.g., addition).
Parse user input and calculate the result.

Expand Features:
Add support for subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Use a loop to repeatedly accept user input until they choose to exit.

Refactor for Scalability:
Organize functions into a separate utils.py module if the code grows.
